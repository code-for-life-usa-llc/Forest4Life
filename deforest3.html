    <h1>Effect Of Deforestation on Wildlife</h1>

    <div id="White">
        <p><em>Forests provide a home to almost 80% of animal species worldwide. Furthermore, forests also provide the space to hunt, find food, reproduce and grow. Basically, forests fulfill all the needs of species that dwell there. Therefore, when forests deplete, species living there lose their natural dwellings. This disturbs their whole life cycle. Also, they are exposed to new environments, 
        not suitable for their biological needs. As a result, wildlife in the deforested area shrinks rapidly to a point where some species go extinct, never to walk the Earth again.</em></p>

        <p><em>Deforestation in an area kicks the wildlife out of that place. No tree covers force animals to find new places to live. While a few species may survive their new surroundings, most of them cannot. Habitat loss drastically impacts the animal population in that area and leads to a severe loss of wildlife.
        Therefore, the loss of habitat is the most damaging impact of deforestation on wildlife. According to the IUCN's red list, habitat loss due to deforestation is the biggest threat to more than 80% of wildlife globally.</em></p>

        <p><em>Animals dwelling in the forest depend on them for food. Loss of forests leads to the shrinking of food sources essential for the survival of wildlife. For example, Panda and mountain Lemurs face a serious threat of extinction due to shrinking bamboo jungles â€“ a primary food source for these animals.
                The International Network for Bamboo and Rattan (INBAR) and the UN Env90ironment Programme's World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) report confirm this and warn that if the situation remains unresolved, we will soon lose a bigger chunk of the Panda and Lemur population.
            Similarly, predatory animals also face the threat of extinction. Failing green covers leads to a severe food shortage for herbivores and their population decline. In the process, predatory animals who feed on those herbivores are also devoid of their food source, seriously affecting their population too.</em> </p>

<h1>Increased Interaction with Humans</h1>
<p id="white"><em>Deforestation leads to encroachment of the human population on forest land and animal habitats. This leads to the confrontation of wildlife with humans. It can prove devastating for the wildlife in those areas.
    It increases the risks of animals being hunted by humans in self-defense and safety. For example, monkeys and other wild animals often enter human dwellings for food. Also, closer boundaries with wildlife could lead to increased poaching activities
    Deforestation and clearing of lands also mean more vehicle activities in the wildlife habitat. These could seriously disrupt the serenity of the environment in which wildlife thrive. Besides, there is also the risk of animals being run over by vehicles.</em></p>

<h1>Deforestation leads to Habitat Fragmentation</h1>

<p id="White"><em>Habitat fragmentation differs from habitat loss. It leads to the development of patches of tree-covered land, which once was a continuous area.
    Habitat fragmentation may lead to too small spaces that prevent wildlife species from thriving. Besides, it also leads to reduced shelter, food, and hunting space.
    
    fact-about-how-deforestation-affects-wildlife  Moreover, a fragmented forest can only support a smaller population of animals. Smaller numbers are more prone to extinction. There is a limited number of species members to mate, which leads to a severe reduction in the gene pool. This leads to unhealthy offspring not suited to survive the harsh conditions.
    
    For example, the Great Ape population of central Africa has been severely affected by habitat fragmentation, which is a direct result of deforestation..</em></p>
